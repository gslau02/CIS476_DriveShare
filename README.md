Environment setup:
1. Make sure you have react, nodejs, and npm installed.
2. In the client directory, run 'npm install' to install node module and dependecies required for frontend.
3. In the server directory, run 'npm install' to install node module and dependecies required for backend.
4. In the server directory, add '.env' file and insert 'MONGODB_URI' constant into the file. You can get the uri from the git repository owner.

Running application:
1. In the server directory, run the server by 'node server.js' command. If the server runs successfully, you will see a message of "Server running on port 3001" in the console window.
2. In the client directory, run the client code by 'npm start' command. If the program runs successfully, the application will run on your default browser.
